# apresse presentation for Code BEAM STO 2018 outline

## Title: APRS-IS Servers on The BEAM

## Explain APRS and APRS-IS

* History of amateur packet radio
* Automatic Position Reporting System (APRS)
* What APRS does and does *not*
* Connecting APRS nodes via APRS-IS

## Explain APRS packet analysis on Erlang

(TBD)

## Explain APRS station display using Elixir

(TBD)

## Conclusion and thoughts

* BEAM is designed for a large-scale and high concurrency projects
* The application of BEAM is *not* restricted to the large-scale projects, however
* Starting small with BEAM languages such as Erlang and Elixir is a good way to prototype 
* You can use BEAM for small projects too
