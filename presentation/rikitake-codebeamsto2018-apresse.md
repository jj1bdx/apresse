# APRS-IS message decoder in Erlang

```erlang
init_cp() ->
    {binary:compile_pattern(<<$>>>),
     binary:compile_pattern(<<$:>>),
     binary:compile_pattern(<<$,>>)}.

decode_header(D, {CPS, CPI, CPR}) ->
    [Header, InfoCRLF] = binary:split(D, CPI),
    [Source, Destrelay] = binary:split(Header, CPS),
    [Destination|Relay] = binary:split(Destrelay, CPR, [global]),
    Info = binary:part(InfoCRLF, 0, erlang:byte_size(InfoCRLF) - 2),
    {Source, Destination, Relay, Info}.
